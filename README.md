# How to Play:
***HEXBEAT*** uses 2 buttons for gameplay, and 2 buttons for handling:
* **[A]** - press **A** to attack the high line
* **[B]** - press **B** to attack the low line
* **[START]** - when prompted, press **START** to begin the game
* **[SELECT]** - when prompted, press **SELECT** to restart the game

Use A and B as appropriate when a matching spell crosses its respective "target zone" in front of the player character. Pressing too early or too late will damage the player--you need to time it just right!
