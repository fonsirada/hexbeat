README draft:

[GAME TITLE] is a short rhythm game made for the original Nintendo Game Boy. Defend yourself by timing your defensive shields to the music, and survive until the end!

# Table of Contents

# How to Play:
*[GAME TITLE]* uses 2 buttons for gameplay, and 2 buttons for handling:
* [A] - press A to attack the high line
* [B] - press B to attack the low line
* [START] - when prompted, press START to begin the game
* [SELECT] - when prompted, press SELECT to restart the game

Use A and B as appropriate when a matching spell crosses its respective "target zone" in front of the player character. Pressing too early or too late will damage the player--you need to time it just right!

Survive 3 waves of increasing difficulty in order to win.
